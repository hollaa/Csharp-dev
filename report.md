## _Implementation of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort in C#_

This document is created for the purposes of explanation of my first implementation of Bubble sort of Merge sort using the programming language C#.

### Bubble sort

Bubble sort as an intuitive simple algorithm that works by swapping the adjacent numbers in the list if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm passes through the whole list multiple times to compare and swap the elements until all the numbers are in the right order.

The algorithm follows these steps:
1. Compare the first element with the next one (elements on indexed 0 and 1), if the first one is greater than the second one, swap them
2. Move to the next pair of elements, review them and swap if necessary. This continues until the end of the list
3. Repeat steps 1. and 2. until all the elements are in the right order, so no other elements need to be swapper (the smallest number is in the beginning and the biggest one is in the end of the list)
